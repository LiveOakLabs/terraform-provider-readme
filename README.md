üìñ Refer to <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/LiveOakLabs/readme/latest/docs>
for the latest provider documentation.

‚òÅÔ∏è Also see our [Go Client for the ReadMe.com API](https://github.com/liveoaklabs/terraform-provider-readme)
that this provider uses.

_This library is developed by [Live Oak Bank](https://liveoakbank.com) and is
not officially associated with ReadMe.com._

## Getting Started

__Terraform >= 1.0+ is required.__

### Configure the Provider

```terraform
provider "readme" {
  # Set the API token here or with the README_API_TOKEN env var.
  # api_token = ""
}

terraform {
  required_providers {
    readme = {
      source  = "liveoaklabs/readme"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}
```

### Manage Resources

Create a version:

```terraform
resource "readme_version" "example" {
  version   = "1.1.0"
  from      = "1.0.0"
  is_hidden = false
}
```

Create an API specification:

```terraform
resource "readme_api_specification" "example" {
  # 'definition' accepts a string of an OpenAPI specification definition JSON.
  definition = file("petstore.json")
  semver     = readme_version.example.version
}
```

Create a category:

```terraform
resource "readme_category" "example" {
  title   = "My example category"
  type    = "guide"
  version = readme_version.example.version
}
```

Create a doc:

```terraform
resource "readme_doc" "example" {
  # title can be specified as an attribute or in the body front matter.
  title = "My Example Doc"

  # category_slug can be specified as an attribute or in the body front matter.
  category_slug = readme_category.example.slug

  # hidden can be specified as an attribute or in the body front matter.
  hidden = false

  # order can be specified as an attribute or in the body front matter.
  order = 99

  # type can be specified as an attribute or in the body front matter.
  type = "basic"

  # body can be read from a file using Terraform's `file()` function.
  body = file("mydoc.md")

  version = readme_version.example.version
}
```

### Use Data Sources

The provider includes several data sources. Refer to the
[provider docs on the Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/LiveOakLabs/readme/latest/docs/data-sources/api_registry)
for a full list with examples.

## Disclaimer About Versioning and Development Status

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently under active development and is versioned using
the `0.x.x` scheme. Breaking changes are likely and will result in an
increment to the minor version (e.g., `0.2.0` to `0.3.0).` Users are strongly
advised not to automatically update to new minor or major versions without
thoroughly testing, as the API and functionality may change significantly
between releases.

A stable `1.x` release is planned for the future once the project meets
certain criteria for feature completeness and stability.

Refer to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for release details.
