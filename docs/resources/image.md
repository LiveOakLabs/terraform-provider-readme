# readme_image (Resource)

Manages Images on ReadMe.com

The images API is not part of the official ReadMe API and therefore not documented or fully featured.

Images are not truly stateful - the provider tracks the local source image for changes and will upload a new image if the source is changed. The provider makes a HEAD request to the image URL to verify its existence. Any change to the source path or checksum will trigger a resource replacement.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Upload an image to ReadMe.
resource "readme_image" "example" {
    source = "example.png"
}

output "image_info" {
    value = readme_image.example
}
```
