  Manages an API specification on ReadMe.com
  The provider creates and updates API specifications by first uploading the definition to the API registry and then creating or updating the API specification using the UUID returned from the API registry. This is necessary for associating an API specification with its definition. Ensuring the definition is created in the API registry is necessary for retrieving the remote definition. This behavior is undocumented in the ReadMe API documentation but works the same way the official ReadMe rdme CLI tool works.
  External Changes
  External changes made to an API specification managed by Terraform will not be detected due to the way the API registry works. When a specification definition is updated, the registry UUID changes and is only available from the response when the definition is published to the registry. When Terraform runs after an external update, there's no way of programatically retrieving the current state without the current UUID. Forcing a Terraform update (e.g. tainting or a manual change) will get things synchronized again.
  Importing Existing Specifications
  Importing API specifications is also limited due to the behavior of the API registry and associating a specification with its definition. When importing, Terraform will replace the remote definition on its next run, regardless if it differs from the local definition. This will associate a registry UUID with the specification.

# readme_api_specification (Resource)

Manages an API specification on ReadMe.com

The provider creates and updates API specifications by first uploading the definition to the API registry and then creating or updating the API specification using the UUID returned from the API registry. This is necessary for associating an API specification with its definition. Ensuring the definition is created in the API registry is necessary for retrieving the remote definition. This behavior is undocumented in the ReadMe API documentation but works the same way the official ReadMe `rdme` CLI tool works.

## External Changes

External changes made to an API specification managed by Terraform will not be detected due to the way the API registry works. When a specification definition is updated, the registry UUID changes and is only available from the response when the definition is published to the registry. When Terraform runs after an external update, there's no way of programatically retrieving the current state without the current UUID. Forcing a Terraform update (e.g. tainting or a manual change) will get things synchronized again.

## Importing Existing Specifications

Importing API specifications is also limited due to the behavior of the API registry and associating a specification with its definition. When importing, Terraform will replace the remote definition on its next run, regardless if it differs from the local definition. This will associate a registry UUID with the specification.

See <https://docs.readme.com/main/reference/uploadapispecification> for more information about this API endpoint.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an API specification resource.
resource "readme_api_specification" "example" {
  # 'definition' accepts a string of an OpenAPI specification definition JSON.
  definition = file("petstore.json")
}

# Output the ID of the created resource.
output "created_spec_id" {
  value = readme_api_specification.example.id
}

# Output the specification JSON of the created resource.
output "created_spec_json" {
  value = readme_api_specification.example.definition
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `definition` (String) The raw API specification definition JSON.

### Optional

- `semver` (String) The semver(-ish) of the API specification. This value may also be set in the definition JSON `info:version` key, but will be ignored if this attribute is set. Changing the version of a created resource will replace the API specification. Use unique resources to use the same specification across multiple versions.

Learn more about document versioning at <https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/versions>.

### Read-Only

- `category` (Object) Category metadata for the API specification. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--category))
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the API specification.
- `last_synced` (String) Timestamp of last synchronization.
- `source` (String) The creation source of the API specification.
- `title` (String) The title of the API specification derived from the specification JSON.
- `type` (String) The type of the API specification.
- `uuid` (String) The API registry UUID associated with the specification.
- `version` (String) The version ID the API specification is associated with.

<a id="nestedatt--category"></a>
### Nested Schema for `category`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String)
- `order` (Number)
- `slug` (String)
- `title` (String)
- `type` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# API specifications can be imported using their ID.
# Importing API specifications is limited due to the behavior of the API
# registry and associating a specification with its definition. When importing,
# Terraform will replace the remote definition on its next run, regardless if it
# differs from the local definition.
terraform import readme_api_specification.example 639fd743a9690100813a13fd
```
