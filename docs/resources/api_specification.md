  Manages API specifications on ReadMe.com by uploading the definition to the API registry and associating it with the

  definition. The behavior is similar to the official rdme CLI but is undocumented in the ReadMe API.
  External Changes
  External changes to API specifications managed by Terraform are not automatically detected. The UUID changes when a
  definition is updated, and the new UUID is only available when published to the registry. To synchronize, force an
  update via Terraform (e.g., taint or manual change).
  Importing Existing Specifications
  Importing is limited due to how the API registry associates specifications with definitions. Terraform will overwrite
  the remote definition on the next run, replacing the UUID.
  Managing Documentation
  API specifications on ReadMe automatically create a documentation page, but it isn't managed by Terraform. Use the
  readme_doc resource with use_slug to manage the documentation page.

# readme_api_specification (Resource)

Manages API specifications on ReadMe.com by uploading the definition to the API registry and associating it with the
specification using the returned UUID. This association is necessary for managing the API specification and its
definition. The behavior is similar to the official rdme CLI but is undocumented in the ReadMe API.

## External Changes
External changes to API specifications managed by Terraform are not automatically detected. The UUID changes when a
definition is updated, and the new UUID is only available when published to the registry. To synchronize, force an
update via Terraform (e.g., taint or manual change).

## Importing Existing Specifications
Importing is limited due to how the API registry associates specifications with definitions. Terraform will overwrite
the remote definition on the next run, replacing the UUID.

## Managing Documentation
API specifications on ReadMe automatically create a documentation page, but it isn't managed by Terraform. Use the
readme_doc resource with use_slug to manage the documentation page.

See the ReadMe API documentation at https://docs.readme.com/main/reference/uploadapispecification for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an API specification resource.
resource "readme_api_specification" "example" {
  # 'definition' accepts a string of an OpenAPI specification definition JSON.
  definition = file("petstore.json")

  # When an API specification is created, a category is also created but is
  # not deleted when the API specification is deleted. Set this parameter to
  # true to delete the category when the API specification is deleted.
  delete_category = true
}

# Output the ID of the created resource.
output "created_spec_id" {
  value = readme_api_specification.example.id
}

# Output the specification JSON of the created resource.
# output "created_spec_json" {
#   value = readme_api_specification.example.definition
# }

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example of associating a doc resource with the API specification's default
# doc that is automatically created.
resource "readme_doc" "example" {
  # This will be the visible name of the API specification's default doc.
  title = "store"

  # Use the API specification's category ID.
  category = readme_api_specification.example.category.id

  # Specify the slug of the created API spec doc. This is the slug of a
  # specification tag.
  use_slug = "store"

  order = 10
  type  = "basic"
  body  = "This is the Pet Store API specification's default doc."
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `definition` (String) Raw API specification definition in JSON format.

### Optional

- `delete_category` (Boolean) Delete the associated category when the resource is deleted.
- `semver` (String) Semver (or similar) for the API specification. This value can be set in the `info:version` key of the definition JSON, but this parameter takes precedence. Changing the version will replace the API specification. Use unique resources for multiple versions. Learn more about document versioning [here](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/versions).

### Read-Only

- `category` (Object) Category metadata for the API specification. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--category))
- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the API specification.
- `last_synced` (String) Timestamp of the last synchronization.
- `source` (String) Creation source of the API specification.
- `title` (String) Title derived from the specification JSON.
- `type` (String) Type of the API specification.
- `uuid` (String) UUID of the API registry associated with this specification.
- `version` (String) Version ID associated with the API specification.

<a id="nestedatt--category"></a>
### Nested Schema for `category`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String)
- `order` (Number)
- `slug` (String)
- `title` (String)
- `type` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# API specifications can be imported using their ID.
# Importing API specifications is limited due to the behavior of the API
# registry and associating a specification with its definition. When importing,
# Terraform will replace the remote definition on its next run, regardless if it
# differs from the local definition.
terraform import readme_api_specification.example 639fd743a9690100813a13fd
```
